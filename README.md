# Intelligent Incubator Control System

## Project Overview

This project presents an Intelligent Incubator Control System designed for efficient and automated egg incubation. It's particularly suitable for farms and research institutions to improve hatching efficiency and success rates. The system utilizes embedded technologies to ensure precise temperature and humidity control, offering an easy-to-monitor and automated operation.

### Practical Application Scenario

#### Temperature Controlled Incubation Environment
- **High Temperature Alarm and Adjustment**: LCD alerts when temperature exceeds threshold, with servo motor rotating the incubation plate for heat dissipation.
- **Low Temperature Adjustment**: LCD displays low temperature warnings, with servo motor maintaining a stable environment.

#### Manual Check Mode
- Enables manual inspection with LCD showing "inspection mode" and the servo motor rotating the plate for easy observation.

### Additional Features
- **Humidity Control**: Automated humidity adjustment.
- **Timing Flip**: Regular servo motor activation for flipping the incubation tray.

### Value Proposition
- **Precise Control**: Maintains appropriate temperature and humidity.
- **Easy Monitoring**: Simplifies regular checks of the incubation process.
- **Automated Operation**: Reduces manual intervention for better efficiency.
